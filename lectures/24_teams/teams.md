## Microsoft's Small Team Practices

* Vision statement and milestones (2-4 month), no formal spec
* Feature selection, prioritized by market, assigned to milestones
* Modular architecture
* Allows small federated teams (Conway's law)
* Small teams of overlapping functional specialists

(Windows 95: 200 developers and testers, one of 250 products)

----
## Microsoft's Feature Teams

* 3-8 developers (design, develop)
* 3-8 testers (validation, verification, usability, market analysis)
* 1 program manager (vision, schedule communication; leader, facilitator) – working on several features
* 1 product manager (marketing research, plan, betas)

----
## Microsoft's Process

* "Synchronize and stabilize"
* For each milestone
    * 6-10 weeks feature development and continuous testing
frequent merges, daily builds
    * 2-5 weeks integration and testing (“zero-bug release”, external betas   )
    * 2-5 weeks buffer

----
## Agile Practices (e.g., Scrum)

* 7±2 team members, collocated
* self managing
* Scrum master (potentially shared among 2-3 teams)
* Product owner / customer representative

----
## Spotify's Squads and Tribes


* Small crossfunctional teams with < 8 members
* Each squad has autonomy to decide what to build, how to build it, and how to work together -- under given Squad mission and product strategy
* Focused on regular independent releases
* Tribes are groups of squads focused on product delivery with a tribe leader (40-100 people)
* Chapters coordinate people in same role across squads

> Large teams (29 people) create around six times as many defects as small teams (3 people) and obviously burn through a lot more money. Yet, the large team appears to produce about the same mount of output in only an average of 12 days’ less time. This is a truly astonishing finding, through it fits with my personal experience on projects over 35 years. - [Phillip Amour, 2006, CACM 49:9](https://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=1151043)

----
## Establish communication patterns

* Avoid overhead
* Ensure reliability
* Constraint latency
* 
* e.g. Issue tracker vs email; online vs face to face


----
## Establishing Interfaces

* When dividing work, need to agree on interface
* Common source of mismatch and friction
* **Examples?**
    - Team A uses data produced by Team B
    - Team C deploys model produced by team A
    - Team D uses model and needs to provide feedback to Team A
    - Team D waits for improvement/feature from model A
*
* Ideally interfaces are stable and well documented

## Conway’s Law

> “Any organization that designs a system (defined broadly) will produce a design whose structure is a copy of the organization's communication structure.” — Mel Conway, 1967

> “If you have four groups working on a compiler, you'll get a 4-pass compiler.”

## Congurence

![](congruence.svg)
<!-- .element: class="plain stretch" -->

Structural congruence,
Geographical congruence,
Task congruence,
IRC communication congruence


----
## Leaky Abstractions for ML?

* Can one team handle data quality, model quality, fairness etc?
* What needs to be exposed at the interface?
* Can divide an conquer work if we do not yet know what the model can do?
*
* Are clear abstractions/interfaces possible?

## The Problem with Cross-Cutting Concerns

![Illustration of the tyranny of the dominant decomposition](tyranny.png)<!-- .element: style="width:600px" -->

----
## Cross-Cutting Concerns

System design involves many inter-related concerns

Teams and engineering abstractions typically hierarchically organized

Forced decision: What can be abstracted in a module and what concepts need to be exposed in interface and shared/coordinated/discussed across modules

*Keep track of concerns that cannot be modularized!*

<!-- references -->

----
## Awareness

* Notifications, meetings
* Brook's documentation book
* Email to all
* Code reviews

----
## Engineering Recommendations for Structuring ML-Enabled Systems

* Decompose the system
* Independent components (e.g. microservices)
* Isolate ML if possible
* Clear, stable interfaces, minimal coupling, documentation
* Monitoring to observe contracts and quality
* Explicitly track cross-cutting, system-level concerns like safety, fairness, security

## Common Challenge: Establishing Interfaces

* Formal vs informal agreements?
* Service level agreements and automated enforcement?
* Close collaboration vs siloed teams?
* 
* Many concerns: prediction accuracy, generalization, execution time, scalability, data quality, data quantity, feedback latency, privacy, explainability, time estimation, ...
* Formal agreements and enforcement expensive, slowing development? see technical debt

----
## Common Collaboration Points

<div class="smallish">

 1. Understanding system requirements and ML capabilities
 2. Understanding ML-specific requirements at the system level, reasoning about feedback loops
 3. Project planning and architecture design
 4. Data needs, data quality, data meaning
 5. Documenting model output
 6. Planning and monitoring for drift
 7. Planning ML component QA (offline, online, monitoring)
 8. Planning system QA (integration, interaction, safety, feedback loops)
 9. Tool support for data scientists 
 10. From prototype to production (pipelines, versioning, operations, user interactions, ...)

## Case Study: Brøderbund

<div class="small">

> As the functional departments grew, staffing the heavily matrixed projects became more and more of a nightmare. To address this, the company reorganized itself into “Studios”, each with dedicated resources for each of the major functional areas reporting up to a Studio manager. Given direct responsibility for performance and compensation, Studio managers could allocate resources freely.

> The Studios were able to exert more direct control on the projects and team members, but not without a cost. The major problem that emerged from Brøderbund’s Studio reorganization was that members of the various functional disciplines began to lose touch with their functional counterparts. Experience wasn’t shared as easily. Over time, duplicate effort began to appear.

----
## Specialist Allocation (Organizational Architectures)

* Centralized: development teams consult with a core group of  specialists when they need help
* Distributed: development teams hire specialists to be a first-class member of the team
* Weak Hybrid: centralized group of specialists and teams with  critical applications hire specialists
* Strong Hybrid: centralized group of specialists and most teams also hire specialists

**Tradeoffs?**

----
## Example: Security Roles

* Everyone: “security awareness” – buy into the process
* Developers: know the security capabilities of development tools and use them, know how to spot and avoid relevant, common vulnerabilities
* Managers: enable the use of security practices
* Security specialists: everything security

## Commitment & Accountability

* Conflict is useful, expose all views
* Come to decision, commit to it
* Assign responsibilities
* Record decisions and commitments; make record available

----
## Bell & Hart – 8 Causes of Conflict

* Conflicting resources.
* Conflicting styles.

----
## Social Loafing

* People exerting less effort within a group
* Reasons
    * Diffusion of responsibility
    * Motivation
    * Dispensability of effort / missing recognition
    * Avoid pulling everybody / "sucker effect"
    * Submaximal goal setting
* “Evaluation potential, expectations of co-worker performance, task meaningfulness, and culture had especially strong influence”

# Learning from DevOps

![DevOps](devops.png)<!-- .element: class="stretch plain" style="width:900px" -->

----
## DevOps: A *culture* of collaboration

* Overcome historic role and goal conflicts between developers and operators
* Joint planning for operations, joint responsibilities for testing and deployment
*
* Joint goals, joint vocabulary
* Joint tools (e.g., Docker, versioning, A/B testing, monitoring)
* Mutual benefits (faster releases, more telemetry, improved reliability, fewer conflicts)
* T-shaped professionals

----
## Changing practices and culture is hard

* Ingrained "us vs them" and blame culture
* Inertia is hard to overcome (“this is how we always did things”)
* Learning cost for new concepts and tools
* Extra effort for new practices (e.g., testing)
* Overwhelmed with current tasks, no time to learn/change
* Poor adoption may cause more costs than benefits

----
## Working on Culture Change

* Bottom-up and top-down change possible
* Often introduced by individual advocates, convincing others
* Always requires supportive management
* Education helps generate buy-in
* Consultants can help with adoption and learning
* 
* Demonstrate benefits in one small project, promote from there

----
## Beyond DevOps

* Organizational culture and DevOps have been well studied
* Learn from joint goal setting, joint vocabulary, win-win-collaborations, joint tooling
*
* *What could this look like for other groups (MLOps, MLDev, SecDevOps, LawML, DataExp, SafeML, UIDev, ...)?*

<!-- discussion -->

# Summary

* Team dysfunctions well studied
* Know the signs, know the interventions
* Small teams, crossfunctional teams
	* Deliberately create teams, respect congruence, define interfaces
	* Hire T-shaped developers
* Create awareness and accountability
